My templates are now loading from Firestore and showing in a grid, but the template cards look too basic (solid blocks with text). I want the Templates page to look exactly like Supergrow’s template gallery (professional LinkedIn carousel template covers).

✅ I want high quality template thumbnails that visually look like real LinkedIn carousel templates, not plain boxes.

✅ What I want (Supergrow Style)
1) Template cards must look premium

Each template card should include:
✅ a real thumbnail preview (not a simple gradient box)
✅ top-left “slides count” pill (example: 5 slides)
✅ top-right optional “New” pill
✅ rounded corners + shadow + hover animation
✅ title below thumbnail (like Supergrow)

2) Improve template thumbnails (important)

Right now I store thumbnail in Firestore as simple SVG gradient.
That’s why it looks weak.

I want you to generate realistic LinkedIn carousel cover designs using SVG (no random photos).

Each thumbnail must include:

✅ big bold title text
✅ subtitle / small description line
✅ author name + handle at bottom left
✅ a “Swipe →” footer area for some templates
✅ small UI decorations (dots, shapes, lines)
✅ different layout patterns for different templates

No random photo images

❌ no dogs, buildings, nature pictures
✅ Only clean LinkedIn business style (typography + shapes + gradients)

3) Template “layout types”

Use multiple layout styles like Supergrow:

cover_bold

cover_minimal

cover_split

cover_quote

cover_stats

cover_story

Each Firestore template already has a layout field.
Use that to generate different thumbnail designs.

Example:

layout = "framework_grid" → thumbnail should show a “Framework” look

layout = "howto_steps" → thumbnail should show step blocks

layout = "stats_clean" → thumbnail should show chart bars icon style

layout = "mistakes_warning" → thumbnail should show warning feel

4) Update the seeding system

Update the Firestore seeding script so that it seeds templates with:
✅ premium SVG thumbnails (Supergrow style)
✅ professional titles (LinkedIn)
✅ slide counts
✅ optional “New” flag

Also add a “Reset & Reseed” button:
✅ delete existing templates in collection
✅ re-seed with better ones

5) UI layout must match Supergrow grid

5 cards per row on desktop (responsive)

equal spacing

cards same size

no weird padding

✅ Final result expected

After this update:

✅ My Templates page should visually look like Supergrow template gallery
✅ Cards should feel like real LinkedIn carousel templates
✅ Clicking any template still opens the editor correctly
✅ Thumbnails must be business-style and consistent

✅ Deliverables

Implement:
✅ better SVG thumbnail generator that looks like real templates
✅ update seeding so templates look premium
✅ update template card UI layout + hover effects
✅ add “Reset & Reseed” button

Do not use random images. Everything must be clean LinkedIn style.
