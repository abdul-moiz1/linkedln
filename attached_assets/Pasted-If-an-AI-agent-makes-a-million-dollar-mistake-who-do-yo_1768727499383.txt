If an AI agent makes a million-dollar mistake, who do you fire? We’re about to onboard digital employees (AI agents) into our companies just without HR, onboarding, or performance reviews. We still call them “tools.” But functionally, they behave like staff. They read sensitive data. They recommend actions. Soon, they’ll execute transactions on our behalf. If there’s no architecture to manage that, you’re not building an AI strategy. You’re building Shadow AI with better branding. To scale this safely, Enterprise Architecture must become the operating system for this new workforce. Just like an OS manages identity, permissions, and processes so the system doesn’t crash, EA must define the rules of engagement for AI agents. At minimum, that operating system must enforce three things: 1️⃣ Identity & Accountability (The ID Badge) Every agent needs a clear identity. When something happens, you must be able to answer: who did this? If you can’t distinguish human actions from agent actions, your audit trail is already broken. 2️⃣ Authority Limits (The Corporate Card) You wouldn’t give a new intern signing authority. Agents need hard boundaries too. Draft the email—but a human sends it. Propose the refund—but a human approves it. 3️⃣ Operational Memory (The Handoff) Real teams share context. Agents need governed, shared memory so they don’t hallucinate, duplicate work, or fight each other across systems. Now the uncomfortable question: Who manages these digital employees? Soon, many organizations will have more AI agents running workflows than humans. Someone will have to decide when an agent gets promoted, retrained, or fired. That’s not a tooling problem. That’s enterprise architecture. Innovation is the engine. Architecture is the steering wheel and the brakes. If you don’t put an operating system around your digital employees now, they won’t just work for you, they’ll quietly start working around you. hashtag#EnterpriseArchitecture hashtag#AgenticAI hashtag#AIGovernance hashtag#Leadership
