My app is working but I have 2 issues:

✅ ISSUE 1: Editor Preview shows “Unsupported layout: howto_steps”

When I open some templates, the editor preview shows this message:
✅ “Unsupported layout: howto_steps”

This is happening because Firestore templates have multiple layouts like:

howto_steps

framework_grid

stats_clean

mistakes_warning

story_format

split_contrast
etc.

But my CarouselPreview component only supports a few layouts.

✅ I want you to fix this properly:

Required Fix

Update CarouselPreview so it supports ALL template layouts that we seeded in Firestore.

For each layout, render a different preview design (simple but unique).

If a layout is unknown, DO NOT show “Unsupported layout”.
Instead fallback to a default preview layout (basic_cover).

✅ Preview should always show:

title

description

authorName + authorHandle

✅ Layout examples:

howto_steps → show 3 step boxes or step lines

framework_grid → show 2x2 grid blocks

stats_clean → show small bar chart blocks

mistakes_warning → show warning style (bold headline)

split_contrast → split layout left/right

✅ ISSUE 2: Too much empty space on Template Gallery page

Templates page layout has a lot of empty whitespace on the right and overall the grid is not filling the page width properly.

✅ I want you to fix the layout so it looks like Supergrow:

Required Fix

The gallery container should stretch to full available width.

Grid should auto-fit templates based on screen size:

Desktop: 4–5 columns

Medium: 3 columns

Mobile: 1–2 columns

Remove unnecessary max-width limits causing empty space.

Ensure grid is centered and has equal spacing.

Make sure sidebar + main content alignment is consistent.

✅ Add a “Gallery Header row”:
Left: “Template Gallery” + subtitle
Right: “Reset & Reseed” button

Header should align with grid width.

✅ Final Result Expected

After fixes:
✅ Editor preview must work for every template layout with no unsupported layout message
✅ Templates page must fill the screen properly (no empty space issue)
✅ Grid must look modern like Supergrow

Please implement these fixes now with clean UI styling.
