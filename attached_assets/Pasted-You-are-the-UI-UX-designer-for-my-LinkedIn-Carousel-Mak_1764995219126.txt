You are the UI/UX designer for my LinkedIn Carousel Maker app.

Improve the entire carousel creation experience based on proven LinkedIn carousel design principles:

1. STRONG HOOK SLIDE
- Make Slide 1 visually bold and extremely readable.
- Large headline text.
- Minimal background distractions.
- High contrast.
- Encourage users to write short, powerful hooks.
- Provide example hooks and enforce short text limits.

2. CONSISTENT SLIDE DESIGN
- Enforce a uniform layout across all slides:
  same font, same spacing, same alignment.
- Use a consistent color palette.
- Every slide should feel like part of a clean series.

3. CLEAR HIERARCHY
- Headline should always dominate.
- Secondary text should be clearly smaller.
- Maintain strong alignment: left, center, or justified consistently.

4. SINGLE IDEA PER SLIDE
- Guide users to keep each slide focused on one idea.
- Add a text limit to prevent clutter.
- Add a “Too much text” warning if they overload.

5. MOBILE-OPTIMIZED
- All text must be readable on a small screen.
- Enforce minimum font sizes.
- Encourage simple backgrounds and fewer elements.

6. EASY-TO-READ STRUCTURE
Update the preview UI to show:
- Slide number at the top right.
- Clean padding around text.
- Smooth edges and rounded corners.
- Simple, non-distracting backgrounds.

7. CTA END SLIDE
- Automatically generate a final slide layout with:
  “Thank you for reading”
  “Follow for more”
  or the user’s chosen CTA.
- Design this slide clean and simple.

8. COLOR + TYPOGRAPHY RULES
- Use a modern, minimal, high-contrast style.
- Suggest 2–3 color palettes.
- Offer preset typography styles:
  • Bold Headline
  • Body Text
  • Small Notes

9. IMAGE GENERATION IMPROVEMENTS
- Update background images to be simple and subtle.
- Avoid complex imagery that interferes with text.
- Encourage plain gradients, abstract shapes, or low-noise patterns.

10. EDITOR LAYOUT IMPROVEMENTS
- Streamline the editor so users move naturally through:
  Choose Type → Write Slides → Preview → Download
- Show live character count.
- Add spacing and alignment guides.
- Make the preview match real LinkedIn proportions exactly.

11. BRANDING + PROFESSIONAL FEEL
- Add a slightly dark overlay on hero backgrounds to improve text readability.
- Introduce cleaner UI spacing and bigger buttons.
- Make the product look modern, friendly, and simple.

GOAL:
Make the whole carousel creation flow match top-tier LinkedIn carousel designs: clean, bold, readable, minimal, and high-performing.
