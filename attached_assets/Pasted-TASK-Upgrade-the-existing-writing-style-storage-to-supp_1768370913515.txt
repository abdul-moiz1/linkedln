TASK:
Upgrade the existing writing style storage to support a full “Style DNA” system
WITHOUT breaking any existing functionality, queries, or Firestore reads.

CURRENT STATE:
There is an existing Firestore field called `styleProfile` with simple attributes
(formality, tone, verbosity, prefersBullets, callToActionFocus) and a single
`writingStyle` string.

This structure is already in use and MUST continue working.

GOAL:
Add a robust, reusable “Style DNA” structure while keeping backward compatibility.

STRICT RULES (DO NOT VIOLATE):
- Do NOT remove or rename existing fields
- Do NOT change existing data types
- Do NOT break current reads/writes
- Do NOT modify authentication or Firebase config
- Only ADD new fields
- Existing UI must continue to work even if it ignores new fields

REQUIRED CHANGES:

1. KEEP the existing structure exactly as-is:
   - styleProfile.formality
   - styleProfile.tone
   - styleProfile.verbosity
   - styleProfile.prefersBullets
   - styleProfile.callToActionFocus
   - writingStyle (string)

2. ADD a new nested object:
   `styleDNA` (map/object)

3. `styleDNA` must include:
   - version (string, e.g. "v1")
   - generatedAt (timestamp)
   - sourceWordCount (number)
   - locked (boolean)

4. Inside `styleDNA.profile`, store:
   - voiceToneRules (string)
   - rhythmFlow (string)
   - structureTemplates (string)
   - languagePreferences (string)
   - doDontRules (string)
   - styleChecklist (array of strings)
   - signatureElements (array of strings)

5. ADD a new field:
   - `writeLikeMePrompt` (string)
   This must be a fully reusable instruction block that can be pasted into an LLM.

6. The old `writingStyle` field should remain as a SHORT SUMMARY
   derived from Style DNA, not removed.

7. If Style DNA is missing, the system should:
   - Fall back to `writingStyle`
   - Fall back to `styleProfile`
   - Never crash or throw

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Update schema only
- Provide the updated Firestore document example
- Provide a helper function or logic comment explaining how future writes
  should update both `styleDNA` AND `writingStyle`
- NO refactors beyond this scope

IMPORTANT:
This is a production system. Be conservative.
Additive changes only. No breaking changes.
