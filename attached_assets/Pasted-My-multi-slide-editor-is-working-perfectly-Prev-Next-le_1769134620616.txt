My multi-slide editor is working perfectly (Prev/Next + left slide list + preview updates).

Now I want the templates to behave like real LinkedIn carousel templates:

✅ Same theme (colors + fonts)
✅ But each slide should have a different layout/style.

Currently, every slide looks identical because my CarouselPreview uses the same layout for all slides.

✅ Required Upgrade
1) Add slideLayouts to templates in Firestore

Update template documents to include a new field:

slideLayouts (array)

Example for a 5-slide template:

"slideLayouts": ["cover", "bullets", "steps", "quote", "cta"]


Example for a 6-slide template:

"slideLayouts": ["cover", "bullets", "bullets", "steps", "proof", "cta"]


✅ slideLayouts length must match slidesCount
✅ If slideLayouts missing, generate defaults automatically:

slide 1 = cover

last slide = cta

middle slides = bullets

2) Update CarouselPreview to support slideLayouts

Modify preview logic so it renders the current slide using:

currentSlideLayout = template.slideLayouts[currentSlideIndex]

And NOT the global template.layout.

3) Create slide layout components

Create reusable slide UI blocks like:

CoverSlide (big title, subtitle)

BulletsSlide (title + bullet points from description)

StepsSlide (3 step boxes)

QuoteSlide (large quote style)

ProofSlide (stats blocks)

CTASlide (call to action + handle)

Each slide layout must share the same theme colors + fonts so they look consistent.

Theme comes from template data like:

template.theme.primaryColor

template.theme.backgroundColor

template.theme.accentColor
(if not available, use default theme)

4) Improve seed templates to include slideLayouts

Update Reset & Reseed so seeded templates include slideLayouts arrays.

Example:

How-To Steps template (6 slides):
["cover","steps","steps","bullets","proof","cta"]

Framework Grid template (5 slides):
["cover","framework","framework","quote","cta"]

5) Editor should show slide type label (optional)

In Slide list on left, show:

Slide 1 (Cover)

Slide 2 (Steps)

Slide 3 (Bullets)
etc.

So user understands why slide design changes.

✅ Final Expected Result

After this:

✅ Slide 1 looks like a real “Cover”
✅ Slide 2 is bullet/steps layout
✅ Slide 3 is different style
✅ Slide 4 is quote or framework style
✅ Slide 5 is CTA

But everything still looks like one template family (same theme).

✅ Implement all these changes now.
