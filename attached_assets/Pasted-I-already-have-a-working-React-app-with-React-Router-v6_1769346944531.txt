I already have a working React app with React Router v6 and a main page /generate-posts working.

Now I want you to design and implement these 4 pages exactly like Supergrow UI:

Pages to design:

/generate-posts/pdf

/generate-posts/youtube

/generate-posts/article

/generate-posts/format

⚠️ Important:

Only UI + front-end design + form structure + basic validations + fake generation output

No backend required for now

These pages must look consistent with Supergrow clean layout shown in screenshots

✅ Global UI Requirements (Supergrow Style)
Layout:

White background, lots of spacing, centered content container

Top heading section (title + subtitle)

Horizontal thin divider line under header

Left aligned form content

Modern rounded input boxes and cards

Use soft border colors (#e5e7eb like Tailwind border-gray-200)

Buttons should look premium, rounded, blue primary button with icon

Reusable Page Header Component:

Create a component named PageHeader which supports:

Back arrow button (goBack)

Title

Subtitle

Divider line below

Example:

"Generate a post from a PDF"

"Upload a PDF and generate a post from it"

Reusable Language Selector:

On all 4 pages show a small language selector row:

icon + “English”

keep it same on every page

✅ Shared Section Component (Same on all 4 pages)

After input area, show this section:

Section title:

"Select Post format or Content style"

Option cards:

Post Formats (default selected)

description text: "Generate your content in different formats that to get you more reach."

button: “+ Select a post format”

Content Style (Beta)

description text: "Generate your content that can mimic your writing style and personalized tone."

Allow selecting one using radio-style UI.

✅ Page 1: Generate Post from PDF (/generate-posts/pdf)
UI:

Page header: "Generate a post from a PDF"

Subtitle: "Upload a PDF and generate a post from it"

Upload area:

Large dashed border box

Upload icon

text: “Choose a file or drag & drop it here.”

button “Browse File”

Accept only .pdf

Instructions box:

Below the Post Formats section, show:

label: "Add your instructions"

textarea with placeholder: “focus on a specific part of the PDF”

Generate button:

Blue rounded button: "Generate"

With sparkle icon

Result card:

After Generate, show:

a loading state: “Generating post...”

then show a card with:

“Generated Post”

a realistic LinkedIn style post text output

✅ Page 2: Generate Post from Youtube (/generate-posts/youtube)
UI:

Header: "Generate a post from a Youtube video"

Subtitle: "Share a Youtube video link and generate a post from it"

Form fields:

Label: "Youtube Video URL"

Input placeholder: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxxx
"

Validation rules:

must include youtube.com/watch?v= OR youtu.be/

show red error text if invalid

Instructions:

label: "Add your instructions"

placeholder: "focus on a specific part of the video"

Generate button:

On click show loading and then output in card as generated post

✅ Page 3: Generate Post from Article (/generate-posts/article)
UI:

Header: "Generate a post from an article"

Subtitle: "Share a link to a blog post and generate a post from it"

Form fields:

Label text exactly like:
“Blog post URL(the URL content should be open and public),
Currently, we don't support PDFs, Google Docs.”

Input placeholder: "https://www.example.com/blog-post
"

Validation:

Must start with http:// or https://

Must not include pdf or docs.google.com

Show error below if invalid

Instructions:

"Add your instructions"

placeholder: "add less emojis"

Generate:

Generate button should create a realistic generated post

✅ Page 4: Format your content (/generate-posts/format)
UI:

Header: "Format your content"

Subtitle: "Use the power of AI to format your clunky content into readable posts"

Form fields:

Large textarea:

label: "Add your content"

placeholder: "Paste your content"

big height like Supergrow

Instructions textarea:

label: "Add your instructions"

placeholder: "add less emojis"

Generate button:

When clicked:

show loading

output formatted version of the content in a result card

include:

Title: “Formatted Output”

Copy button on top-right

✅ Navigation Requirements

Ensure all 4 pages are included in App Router

Each card on /generate-posts should navigate properly:

PDF card -> /generate-posts/pdf

Youtube card -> /generate-posts/youtube

Article card -> /generate-posts/article

Format content card -> /generate-posts/format

✅ File Structure Requirements

Create these files:

src/pages/PdfPostGenerator.jsx

src/pages/YoutubePostGenerator.jsx

src/pages/ArticlePostGenerator.jsx

src/pages/FormatContent.jsx

Reusable components:

src/components/PageHeader.jsx

src/components/ContentStyleSelector.jsx

src/components/GeneratedResultCard.jsx

Also create src/pages/styles/generatorPages.css (or use Tailwind classes)

✅ Output Behavior

Use useState to store:

input values

errors

loading state

generated text result

Use fake AI generation like:

setTimeout 1200ms

return a sample LinkedIn post

Now implement everything fully with clean modern UI and ensure pages match Supergrow design.
