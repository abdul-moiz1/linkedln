You are working on a Firebase (Firestore) + frontend Carousel Maker app.

OBJECTIVE
- Remove ALL non-Basic templates from both Firestore and UI.
- Keep ONLY 20 templates under the "Basic" category.
- Ensure data consistency and do NOT break existing UI logic.

STRICT REQUIREMENTS
1. Completely remove these categories everywhere:
   - Professional
   - Creative
   - Elite
2. The app must only support:
   - category: "Basic"
3. Total templates in Firestore must be exactly 20.

FIRESTORE CHANGES
- Collection: carouselTemplates

Steps:
1. Delete all documents where:
   category != "Basic"

2. Ensure remaining documents:
   - category is exactly "Basic"
   - each has a unique templateId
   - total count is capped at 20
   - if more than 20 Basic templates exist:
     - keep the first 20 (by createdAt)
     - delete the rest

Each remaining template document MUST include:
{
  templateId: string (unique, stable),
  title: string,
  category: "Basic",
  slidesCount: number,
  previewImages: string[],
  isNew: boolean,
  createdAt: timestamp
}

Do NOT:
- Rename the collection
- Change templateId values once assigned
- Touch user-generated content

FRONTEND UI CHANGES
1. Remove all category filters, tabs, or labels related to:
   - Professional
   - Creative
   - Elite

2. UI should:
   - Always display only "Basic"
   - Fetch only category == "Basic" from Firestore
   - Render a maximum of 20 templates

3. Remove any hardcoded category references or badges except:
   - "Basic"

4. Ensure:
   - Template cards still show preview image, title, slides count
   - Hover slideshow still works (if implemented)
   - templateId is used internally only (not displayed)

FINAL STATE CHECK
- Firestore has exactly 20 templates
- All templates belong to "Basic"
- UI shows only Basic section
- No references to Professional / Creative / Elite exist in code or UI
- App behavior and layout remain unchanged

Apply changes carefully and safely.
